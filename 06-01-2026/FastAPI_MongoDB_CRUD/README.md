# FastAPI_CRUD_Assignment
Create FastAPI project for CRUD operations in python
This project is a simple CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) API built using FastAPI with MongoDB as the database. 
It demonstrates how to structure a FastAPI application, use routers, validate data with Pydantic models, and perform database operations using PyMongo. 
The API allows creating and retrieving todo tasks and can be easily extended with update and delete functionality.
